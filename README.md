Modular Python package for loading of measurement/data files, data analysis and visualization with a graphical user interface.

Data files of specific type are loaded and analyzed using converter modules.

Instructions on use and adding converters can be found in instructions.txt.

Converters included: xrdml XRD files, image files, generic files.

Extra modules included for data analysis: fitting of thin film (substrate + epilayer) XRD spectra. Gradient analysis for determining flux ratios in MBE.

Installation:
- Install required packages: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, scipy, pillow, openpyxl.
- Install optional packages: xrayutilities (for XRD fitting).
- Copy all files (examples are optional) to any directory and run "python gui.py" from the command line.
